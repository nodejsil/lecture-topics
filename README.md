# Lecture Topics
This repo is intend for discussing suggested lecture topics (as issues) for the [Israeli Node.js community](http://www.nodejsil.com) monthly meetups.

# Instructions
If you think of an interesting topic for a lecture you would like to see (or give) then please open an issue - not before making sure an equivalent issue does not already exist.

Lecture topics will be prioritized based popular demand and lecturers availability. Issues unrelated to Node.js topics will be summarily closed.

If you find yourself or others suitable for giving a specific lecture, please suggest so in the issue comments.

Once a lecture is scheduled, a link will be provided and the issue will be closed.

# Misc
All lectures are assumed to be held in Hebrew unless stated otherwise.
